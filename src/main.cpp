Because of my keen interest in machine learning and data analysis, I have started my master’s in Medical Engineering (Medical Image and Data Processing). During my master's study, I have developed my basic understanding of deep learning, pattern recognition, and analysis. I actively participated in a deep learning exercise course in which I constructed fundamental neural network architectures such as FCNN, CNN, and RNN. This hands-on experience greatly contributed to my understanding of these model structures. I have worked on several image processing and deep learning projects and improved my programming skills in Python and C++." << std::endl;

This role provided me with the chance to enhance my analytical and programming skills. I have also wrote my master’s thesis at FAPS-Erlangen. The topic is “High-Precision Calibration of Multi-Camera Systems” (https://github.com/TabassumNova/Multi_Camera_Calibration). For multi-camera calibration framework, I have employed state of art methods with modification to enhance the system\'s robustness, particularly in situations where camera views do not overlap. I have also developed a PyQt user interface to analyze the calibration quality. ' << std::endl;
